# Hangman

This repository contains my attempt to solve the hangman problem in python. I have used ngrams along with frequency analysis to solve the problem. More details will be provided in other notebook.

## What is Hangman?

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>)

For more detail, about the algorithm, have a look at the `algorithm.pdf` file in the `algorithm` folder. The same details can also be found in the [algorithm.md](algorithm.md) file.
